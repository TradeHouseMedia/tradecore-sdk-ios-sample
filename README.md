# Tradecore iOS SDK

The current repository serves as a guide for mobile publishers who integrate the Tradecode SDK into their apps. 

The repository structure: 

- `/demo-apps` folder contains Xcode projects of the applications that demonstrate different scenarios of integrating the Tradecore SDK
- `/docs` folder contains the public documentation for Tradecore SDK. All code snippets in the docs are taken from the demo applicaitons so you can easyly switch from theory to practice.

## SDK Overview

Tradecore SDK is a native iOS library that enables seamless integration with PrebidMobile, Amazon, Google Ad Manager and Google Interactive Media Ads. It simplifies the implementation process by providing automatic integrations and handling configuration management internally, allowing developers to get up and running quickly with minimal manual setup.

## Integration Prerequisites

The minimum deployment target is **iOS 12.0**.

We assume the [Cocoapods](cocoapods.org) dependency manager is already integrated into the project. If not follow the **Get Started** instructions on [cocoapods.org](cocoapods.org).
